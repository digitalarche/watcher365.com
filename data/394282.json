  "description": "Label-based protection support is now possible for Azure SQL, Azure Data Lake Storage, and Amazon S3 buckets, all within Microsoft Purview Information Protection. You may already know how to protect Microsoft 365 data like documents or emails with sensitivity labels, and you will now be able to apply these labels and the related protections to these additional sources. In addition, you will have a consistent framework for your sensitive information by allowing your existing label scheme and extending it to apply within these sources.",
