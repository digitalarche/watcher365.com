  "description": ",If your tenant has completed AI-indexing, a very small subset of topics will now be available to all users, even without an assigned Topics license. Any user in your organization will be able to view their associated \"MyTopics\" that appear in their \"suggested\" and \"confirmed\" connection webparts of Topic Center home, the Topic adaptive card for Viva Connections, and the People Profile card. They can confirm or remove these associations.",
