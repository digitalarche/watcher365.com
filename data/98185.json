  "description": "Today, customers can only create 500 block and 500 allow entries in sender, URL and file category in Tenant allow/block list. Going ahead, customers with MDO P2 or E5 security can create 5000 allows and 10000 blocks in Tenant allow/block list for sender, URL and file category. Spoof in Tenant allow/block list will remain unaffected by this change and all SKUs will have 1024 entries for both allows and blocks.",
