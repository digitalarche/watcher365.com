  "description": "This feature is designed to enhance transparency by introducing a notification banner that alerts users when keywords embedded in hidden content, such as hyperlinks or encoded strings, trigger a compliance policy match. With this update, investigators will be able to quickly recognize that some or all keyword matches are not immediately visible in the main content body, saving time and ensuring a more efficient triage experience.",
