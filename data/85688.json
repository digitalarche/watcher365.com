  "description": "The Planner task notes field will support rendering rich text formatting (bold, italics, underline, and more). Users can insert rich text into task notes. Support for images in the notes field will not be included with this feature release but we are tracking that capability on our backlog. Note: We will not be rolling out to GCC-High and DoD at this time. When ready, we will advise via Message Center. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.",
