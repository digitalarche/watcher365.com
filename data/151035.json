  "description": "<div>Copilot gives your organization protected AI chat for the web with commercial data protection for Entra ID users. With Copilot, user and business data are protected and will not leak outside the organization. What goes in—and comes out—remains protected. Your organization’s chat data is not saved, Microsoft has no eyes-on access to it, and it is not used to train the models. Copilot with commercial data protection is available in Bing, Edge, and Windows. </div><div> </div><br>More info: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/bing-chat-enterprise/",
