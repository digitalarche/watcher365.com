  "title": "Microsoft Teams: New Meeting Option and Meeting Policy \"Turn off copying or forwarding of meeting chat\" (Premium)",
  "description": "&quot;Turn off copying or forwarding of meeting chat&quot; is a new meeting option that gives meeting organizer the option to disable copying and sharing features on meeting chat messages for participants in order to reduce the risk of data leak. Once this restriction is enabled, meeting chat participants will not be able to copy chat messages using menu option or keyboard shortcut, forward messages or share messages to Outlook. There is also a new Meeting Policy setting in Teams admin center for admin to control whether user can see or use this feature in Meeting Options page. Admin can also set the default value for this meeting option in Meeting Templates they create.",
