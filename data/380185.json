  "description": "We are Updating the experience for end user allow and block list management of their emails. With one click, end users will block emails from unwanted senders and prevent those emails from showing up in their default quarantine view anymore as well as in their Quarantine notifications. End users will also be able to allow emails from trusted senders and prevent future emails from those senders from landing in quarantine given there are no Admin overrides in place. End users will also have visibility into Admin overrides that led to a Quarantined email message if there is one.",
