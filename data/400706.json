  "description": "Using people count information, the room video tile is dynamically re-sized in Gallery view. If there is only one user in the room, the video tile will be the same size as the remote participant tile. If there is more than one user in the room, the room video tile will be 4x the size of the remote participant tile. Admins will be available to turn on/off the people count capability.",
