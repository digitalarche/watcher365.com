  "description": "When users click to play a video in the Highlighted content web part (carousel and filmstrip layout) section on a SharePoint Page, the video will play inline. This feature allows users to watch a video without being taken off the SharePoint Page and keeps the video playing while users browse/scroll through other contents on the Page.\n\nWe have adjusted our priorities to focus on delivering experience improvements that better align with customer needs and as a result, this feature has been removed from our public roadmap for now.",
