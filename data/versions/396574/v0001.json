  "description": "We are improving how suggested times are shown when scheduling a meeting. We are removing the automatically shown suggested times and instead you will need to enable a switch - Find a time - if you want to see suggested times. If you enable the toggle, the new availability view on time suggestion tiles will make it easier to find a suitable time with more clarity on everyone's availability. This update will be available in the new Outlook for Windows and web. #newoutlookforwindows",
