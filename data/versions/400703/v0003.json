  "description": "Joining SIP-based conferencing services like Google Meet, Zoom, Cisco Webex, and others via Teams Rooms offers a seamless collaboration experience, mirroring the native Teams interface. This integration supports features such as 1080p video, dual screen, various layout options, HDMI input, and others contingent on the third-party platform's in-meeting controls. A SIP calling plan from a CVI partner, currently Pexip, is necessary. This is available for Teams Rooms customers with a Pro license.",
