  "description": "To protect your most sensitive content, users of Microsoft 365 Apps can now use Double Key Encryption (DKE) for files and emails using the built-in labeling client. With DKE, Microsoft stores one key in Microsoft Azure and you hold the other key, ensuring that&nbsp;only you&nbsp;can ever decrypt protected content, under all circumstances. Sensitivity labels configured with DKE in Microsoft Purview Compliance Portal are now available for users in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook to publish or consume content protected with DKE.",
