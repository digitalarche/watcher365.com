  "description": ",To enhance the user experience for editing and creating policies, we will be making improvements to the Trigger, Trigger threshold, Indicator threshold, and Summary pages of the policy wizard. Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies based on their own internal policies, governance, and organizational requirements. Built with privacy by design, users are pseudonymized by default, and role-based access controls and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy.",
