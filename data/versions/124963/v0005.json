  "description": "Enhanced security mode is being turned on by default to “Balanced” mode for x64 Windows, x64 macOS, x64 Linux, and ARM64 systems. Also, administrators have 2 new policies to manage the Enhanced security mode user experience: EnhanceSecurityModeIndicatorUIEnabled and EnhanceSecurityModeOptOutUXEnabled.  More info.  Note: We have made the decision to cancel this planned release. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. ESM will not be turned on by default, but users can still manually opt into ESM to receive further protection when browsing with Edge. <br>More info: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/deployedge/microsoft-edge-security-browse-safer",
