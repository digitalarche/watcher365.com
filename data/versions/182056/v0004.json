This enables users to perform phishing-resistant authentication using the devices that they already have.&nbsp;</span><span>The existing FIDO2 authentication methods policy and end user experiences will be changed to support this preview release. For organizations to opt-in to this preview, admins will need to enforce key restrictions to allow specified passkey providers in the FIDO2 policy.</span> </div><div> </div>",
