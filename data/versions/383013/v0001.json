  "description": "Admins can customize their organization's branding assets onto Edge for Business. Admins can enable and configure branding onto profile-related UI for profiles signed in with an Entra ID (formerly known as Azure Active Directory) account. You can configure your organizationâ€™s details such as name to the profile pill; name, logo, and brand color to the profile flyout; and logo to overlay the Edge for Business taskbar icon.
