  "description": "Introducing speaker recognition for Teams Rooms on Windows. This feature provides live transcription with speaker identification, creating a unique \"voiceprint\" for each participant. With speaker recognition, Copilot in Teams can deliver meeting summaries, insights, and action items by attributing contributions to individual speakers. Participants can easily set up a voice profile using the Teams Desktop app. Users' individual voice signatures are stored securely in your organization's tenant in the Microsoft Cloud, ensuring accurate capture of every contribution in every meeting.",
