  "description": "This release will add two new graphs to Amplify reporting: dwell time and clicks. The dwell time graph will indicate the average time users spend reading a publication, giving important insight into the engagement of users with the Amplify campaign. The clicks graph will indicate the number of times a link in the publication was clicked by a reader, again giving important insight into the engagement level of users. Both of these metrics will be supported from SharePoint and Outlook channels.",
