  "title": "Microsoft Copilot (Microsoft 365): Copilot in Excel support for formula data summaries in rows and cells",
  "description": "Add a single formula to summarize column data into one cell. Today, full column calculations produce a unique result in each row, but this new feature gives you the option to calculate all data in a column together to return one result. You can also create a row with formulas that apply for relevant columns; for example, an \"add total sales row\" will add a SUM formula underneath every column that has sales data.",
