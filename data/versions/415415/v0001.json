The new calendar in Teams is designed to be familiar and reliable, as it’s one unified calendar that works across new Outlook for Windows, Outlook on the web, Microsoft Places, and now Microsoft Teams. With this update, users will see the ‘New calendar’ toggle at the top right of the calendar app in Teams. New calendar is off by default, and users can toggle to try the new experience.",
