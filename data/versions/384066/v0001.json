  "description": "We continue to expand our Survivable Branch Appliance (SBA) capabilities. We are adding support for call transfer, forwarding, and the ability to manage call routing settings for calls to a call queue or auto attendant, in the event of an outage. If incoming calls to a call queue or auto attendant are received during an outage, organizations will have the option to choose to redirect these calls to an alternate call queue or auto attendant or to reach a specific user within the site, ensuring that important calls are not missed.",
