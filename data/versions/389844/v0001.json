  "title": "Microsoft Teams: Programmatic Desktop Sharing",
  "description": "With desktop sharing (made available OOB), meeting presenters can now screen-share all their meeting apps directly onto the stage for improved collaboration. We are introducing programmatic desktop sharing, which allows developers to enable screensharing specific pieces of app content. Unlike the currently existing share to stage functionality, meeting participants cannot interact with the shared app; they have a view-only mode of the presenter's app screen similar to screen sharing, but in one click. The shared content is also automatically captured in the meeting recording. This works great for co-consumption scenarios and requires little developer investment.",
