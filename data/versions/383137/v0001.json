  "title": "Microsoft Clipchamp: New feature for silence removal (pauses) in Clipchamp",
  "description": "We think editing your video could be a quick job but isn't necessarily so sometimes. Silence removal uses AI auto transcription to transcribe your audio. We infer pauses in your speech transcription and any gaps in the speech we detected for more than 3 seconds is considered a pause. We provide you with the option to remove all pauses at once with a single click or to review each pause where you can adjust and consider ones you want to keep.",
