  "description": "We are introducing a new version of the service health issue details pane (the surface that appears when you click on a service incident or service advisory to view details).\n\nThe new version substantially reduces the amount of duplicated text and brings key information forward with improved formatting.  This gives you quicker access to the information you need, reducing the time and effort required to get up to speed on service incident details.",
