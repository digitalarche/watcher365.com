  "description": "Save time with AI-based file suggestions in chat. As an expansion of suggested replies in chats, Teams uses AI to surface files when it detects in the conversation intent to share a file. Now, users will be able to respond to their chat message and attach a file in one click. Note: The Government clouds release has been delayed. We will add a new roadmap item when appropriate. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. Additionally, this feature is only available in the new Teams experience.",
