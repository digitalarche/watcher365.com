Users can configure their notification settings in Teams settings > Notifications and activity > Apps > Meeting Recap to control where the notification is surfaced (Activity and banner, Activity only, Off) as well as which meetings have notifications enabled (for only meetings with RSVP selection of “Follow,” or all other meetings, or both).",
