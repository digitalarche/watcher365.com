  "description": "Users can quickly join a meeting from a Teams Room even without forwarding the invite to the room calendar by scanning a QR code using their native mobile camera. The user will then enter the Teams mobile companion mode experience on their mobile. The QR code is found on the Teams Room home screen and can also be scanned to start an ad-hoc meeting or cast content from their mobile to the Teams Room display. If the user does not have the Teams mobile app, they will be directed to download it after scanning the QR code. IT admins can control the QR code feature in the device settings and the Teams admin center. This feature supports cross-tenant meetings when the organization settings and user policies allow it.",
