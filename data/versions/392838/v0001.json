  "description": ",The first release of Priority cleanup enables admins to create a recurring exception to delete items under a broader retention policy and/or legal hold. Creating a Priority cleanup will require a separate security role, multiple approvers, and will have a complete audit trail. For example, you could reduce storage space by deleting meeting recordings, even when the OneDrive location has a longer retention policy. The feature also helps with scenarios such as data spillage cleanup and processing right to be forgotten requests.",
