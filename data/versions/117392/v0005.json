  "description": "*This feature has been deprioritized for the time being as Whiteboard prioritizes other highly requested feature development. As a workaround, Whiteboard has features that accommodate lightweight voting such as sticky note reactions that can be used. \n\nThis feature will bring a more formalized voting function to Whiteboard. This can be used in order to gather feedback from participants to come to conclusions during various activities. This will have the ability to be anonymous or not.",
