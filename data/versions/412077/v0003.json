  "title": "Microsoft Teams: Audio zones enable Mesh creators to craft custom audio experiences",
  "description": "We will not release Audio Zones for Mesh Toolkit at this time. We are sorry for any inconvenience and will continue to share updated roadmap entries as additional Mesh features and functionality become available in Teams. Spatial audio in Mesh provides a realistic recreation of how sound moves in the real world, with the volume of people speaking or media playing getting lower of as you move away from the source of the sound. The introduction of audio zones enables creators to craft custom audio experiences for the intended use of a space with features such as extended audio drop off distances for conversations that happen in a large area, or restricting what audio can enter a given area, to allow smaller groups to have lively conversations without disrupting their neighbors.",
