  "description": "When scoping policies to Microsoft 365 Groups in Teams DLP policies, Teams standard and shared channel charts are currently protected by the policies. This change will automatically extend the protection to 1:1/n (non-channel) chats. There is no longer a need to add users or security groups to protect these chats, except for customers that have enabled optical character recognition (OCR) in Teams chat.",
