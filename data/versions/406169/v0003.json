  "description": "Microsoft is simplifying how users can add their Microsoft 365 for work or school accounts to Outlook mobile by allowing them to use a QR code instead of typing their username and password. This experience will roll out first to Outlook on the web. From there, users will see a new button in Help labeled “Outlook mobile.\" Once they click it, a QR code will appear. Users can scan the QR code from within Outlook mobile following the steps for \"Add account\" to add their account without the need to type their usernames and passwords.",
