  "title": "Microsoft Viva: Viva Goals - Request License for Others",
  "description": "This feature enables all unlicensed users to request a license from their IT Admin. IT Admins see these requests in MAC and either approve or decline them. Today, unlicensed users who get errors while trying to sign in cannot proceed. With this feature, they can at least express intent to their IT Admin to start using Goals. Also, Org Admins can now request licenses for all unlicensed users in their Goals Organizations, thus unblocking them from using Goals. This item is no longer accurate and is being removed from the roadmap.\n",
