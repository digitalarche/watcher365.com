  "title": "Microsoft 365: Multi-Geo In-Region Routing",
  "description": "Multi-Geo In-Region Routing (IRR) enables customers to control the routing of inbound emails to comply with regional data regulations. IRR ensures emails sent to users within specific geo-regions are processed and stored in their respective region. By directing emails to Accepted Domains that are associated with specific geo-regions and users located in those same geo-regions, IRR ensures that emails are fully processed and stored in the user's region. This keeps data within the userâ€™s Preferred Data Location (PDL), enhancing data sovereignty and compliance.",
