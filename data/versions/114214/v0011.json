  "title": "Microsoft Teams: Frosted Glass Backgrounds in Teams Meetings",
  "description": "We are not rolling out this feature at this time and will make a new announcement when we have an updated timeline. Frosted Glass is a type of background effect that helps users keep their privacy with a background blur, but in a more professional and creative way. It let users have graphics with a blur effect together. Frosted Glass can be activated with a PNG image, that usually comes with some graphics in a transparent background. With the new frosted glass effects, the transparent area is turned into a blur background while the graphic remains as the part of background effect. Available only in the new Microsoft Teams experience.",
