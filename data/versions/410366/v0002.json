  "description": "If users want to change what appears behind them in their video meeting or call, they can either blur their background, use Teams virtual background templates, or with a Teams Premium license, they can change their Teams meeting background to a branded logo or image specific to their company. With this new feature, now users on the new VDI solution for Teams can also replace their background entirely with any image they want by uploading it through the 'Video effects and Settings' option.",
