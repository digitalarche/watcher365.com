  "description": "The initial version of PST support in new Outlook for Windows will enable users to open \"*.pst\" files (a.k.a. Outlook Data Files), read all e-mail messages within the \"*.pst\" file, and search e-mail messages within the \".pst\" file. This initial support is limited to Mail items and is read-only. All Calendar, Contacts, and Tasks data saved in the \"*.pst\" files are still there, but they cannot be accessed in this initial version. #newoutlookforwindows",
