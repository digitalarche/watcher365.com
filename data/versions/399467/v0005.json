  "description": "The first phase PST (a.k.a. Outlook Data File) support in the new Outlook for Windows provides read-only access to Mail items within *.pst files. Users will be able to open *.pst files, read their emails within *.pst files, and search *.pst files for emails. All Calendar, Contacts, and Tasks data saved in the *.pst files are still there, but they cannot be accessed in this preview. Next releases will expand PST support capabilities.\n",
