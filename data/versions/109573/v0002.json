  "description": "Collaborative annotations, available now, enable meeting participants with the Presenter role to enable annotations after sharing their screen. This allows everyone in the meeting to draw, add a note, react, highlight text, and more to share their thoughts right on the content, live with everyone else. Now, participants sharing their screen will have the ability to save content with collaborative annotations as a Whiteboard, enabling all meeting participants to revisit this content and continue collaborating after the meeting.",
