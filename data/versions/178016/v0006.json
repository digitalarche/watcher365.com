Once turned off, users will not see the feature in the frontend. \n\nOnce released, this setting is available for admins to use any time. If turning off private messages in existing networks, users will lose access to their messages. All content remains ingested and available via eDiscovery.  This item has launched and is being removed from the roadmap.",
