  "description": "The update offers analysts and investigators the ability to filter out any activity that was already reviewed in a past alert for a user so they can focus their review on new activities that may lead to a data security incident. Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies to manage security and compliance. Built with privacy by design, users are pseudonymized by default, and role-based access controls and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy.",
