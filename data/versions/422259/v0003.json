  "description": "We will not release this feature at this time. We are sorry for any inconvenience and will continue to share updated roadmap entries as additional features and functionality become available. To streamline your workflow and reduce notifications, we've enhanced our notification system so that shift request alerts are now exclusively sent to schedule group owners, and not all owners of a team. This targeted approach ensures that the right people receive the necessary updates, helping team owners maintain focus.",
