  "description": "We’re introducing the\nability to watch Stream videos inline in Outlook on the web and the new Outlook\nfor Windows. Soon, if someone pastes a Stream video link in a supported Outlook app and sends it to\nyou, you will be able to watch it directly in\nyour inbox. The videos will play inline for recipients within the same\norganization, meaning you will not have to leave Outlook to watch the video.\nRecipients outside the organization, and those not using the new Outlook or web, will see a link to the\nvideo which they can watch in the Stream web app (depending on the\norganization’s file sharing settings).",
