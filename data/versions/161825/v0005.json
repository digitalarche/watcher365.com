  "description": "Front Row now promotes pinned or spotlighted participants to the center stage when there is no shared content in the single and dual display mode. For single display mode, when no one is pinned, spotlighted or sharing content, the most recent active speaker video will be promoted to the center. In dual display mode, when no one is pinned, spotlighted or sharing content, the two most recent active speaker videos will be promoted to the center on each screen. If someone is sharing content, the most recent active video speaker will be promoted on the right screen.",
