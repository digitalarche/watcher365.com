  "description": "When it comes to how links to cloud-hosted Word, Excel, or PowerPoint files should open, you may prefer they open in a browser, desktop apps, or directly in Teams. Now, your Teams file open preference will extend to across Microsoft 365 apps, creating a consistent ‘open file’ experience. If you prefer, you will still be able to choose your Teams file open preference separately.",
