  "description": "Your organization can now disable connected experiences for privacy concerns without impacting data security policies such as sensitivity labels. Services associated with Microsoft Purview (e.g. sensitivity labels and rights management) are no longer controlled by policy settings to manage privacy controls for Microsoft 365 Apps. Instead, these services will rely on their existing security admin controls in Purview portals.",
