  "title": "Microsoft Teams: Only meeting organizers, co-organizers, and transcript initiator can change spoken language setting",
  "description": "We’re changing the default permissions for who can set the spoken language for a meeting. Now, when transcription is enabled (whether by itself or when recording or Copilot are enabled) only the meeting organizer, co-organizer, and person who initiated the transcript can change the spoken language for the meeting. This is to ensure accurate transcription of everyone’s speech during the meeting since the spoken language setting and the spoken language used during discussion must match for transcript accuracy. If transcription is not enabled, all meeting participants will be able to change the meeting spoken language.",
