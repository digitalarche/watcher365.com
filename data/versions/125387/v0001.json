  "description": "With Voice isolation, you can enjoy\nclear and uninterrupted calls or meetings, no matter where you are. This\nfeature uses AI to filter out all background noise, including other people's\nvoices. By leveraging your voice profile, this advanced noise suppression\ncapability ensures only the userâ€™s voice is transmitted. Whether you are in a\nbusy office, a noisy cafe, or a crowded airport, you can communicate with\nconfidence and clarity. Voice\nisolation is powered by our advanced deep learning, speech services, and\naudio processing technology, and it shows our dedication to solving user\nproblems with AI and enhancing audio quality and experience.",
