  "description": "There is now increased information in the alert email notification sent to the Data Loss Prevention (DLP) admin upon a DLP policy match. Previously a DLP alert email only included the user activity and the type of sensitive information matched in the alert. Now, DLP admins will get additional context such as alert ID, policy details, device details, and more. This will help admins quickly assess the priority of an alert and determine the next steps before navigating to the Microsoft Purview DLP alerts page or Microsoft 365 Defender DLP alerts page.",
