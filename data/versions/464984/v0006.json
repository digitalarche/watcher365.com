  "description": "Microsoft Copilot with enterprise data protection for the GCC environment is available at no additional cost for Microsoft 365 GCC users who sign in with their Microsoft Entra account (no Microsoft 365 Copilot license required). For users signed in with a Microsoft Entra account, Copilot offers enterprise data protection (EDP) and a simplified, ad-free user interface designed for work, powered by the latest large language models with optional web grounding. The general availability of this release will be delivered to the users with web grounding OFF by default to meet US Government requirements. This will help protect sensitive information which should not leave the GCC compliance boundary. <br>More info: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/copilot/overview",
