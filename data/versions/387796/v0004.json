  "description": "First-time users of Microsoft Stream will see informational modals that explain what Stream is and its basic functionality. Users will be able to close these modals at any step. When the tenant acquires new premium functionalities, such as Copilot in Stream, more modals will be displayed explaining the new functionalities.\n\nWe have adjusted our priorities to focus on delivering experience improvements that better align with customer needs and as a result, this feature has been removed from our public roadmap for now.",
