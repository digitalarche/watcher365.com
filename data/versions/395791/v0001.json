  "title": "Microsoft Purview compliance portal: Data Lifecycle Management - Record opening behavior improvement in Office client applications (Word, Excel, & PowerPoint)",
  "description": "When a user opens a file in Office client applications (Word, Excel, & PowerPoint) that has a retention label managing the file as a locked record, it will now open as read-only and immediately not allow any user edits. A message will explain to the user why they cannot edit the file. This improvement brings parity to the behavior already in place for the online versions of these Office applications.",
