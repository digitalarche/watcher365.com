  "title": "SharePoint: Advanced Video Analytics for Clipchamp Premium",
  "description": "We are building the next set of analytics features that would help video creators to better understand the audience and video viewing patterns. These features would be available as a part of the Clipchamp Premium license. Views by geolocation: Geolocation shows the views of the video as a percentage of total views from different countries over the last 7 days, 30 days, and 90 days. Usage by devices: This metric shows the views of the video as a percentage of total views from different devices (desktop, mobile, etc.) over the last 7 days, 30 days, and 90 days. Average watch time: It represents the total playback minutes of a video across multiple sessions divided by unique sessions. It reflects the average time spent by a user while watching the video over its lifetime. Note: To better align our features with customer needs, the Microsoft Stream advanced video analytics feature has been canceled to prioritize other key areas of development.",
