  "description": "Learn more about topics being discussed in your organization without leaving Outlook Desktop. With this feature, Viva Topics can detect that a topic is mentioned in the email that is currently in focus in read mode. In this case, Viva Topics will prompt the user to open the Viva Insights panel where they can see a list of all topics referenced in the email along with a view of the topic descriptions and the people/resources associated with the topics. This item is being removed from the roadmap as it is no longer accurate.  We apologize for the inconvenience.",
