  "description": "With private line, users will be able to have a private second phone number that they can make available to a select set of callers to call them directly, bypassing delegates, admins, or assistants. Inbound calls to the private line will be distinguished by a unique notification and ringtone. The private line will support incoming calls only. Note: We have updated the cloud instances to reflect the current state. We will create a new roadmap with a new timeline when available.",
