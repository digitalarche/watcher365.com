  "title": "Meeting organizers can manage who can record and transcribe meetings (Premium)",
  "description": "We are expanding the existing ‘Who can record’ control for meeting organizers to include transcription. With this change, meeting organizers with a Teams Premium license will see a control called ‘Who can record and transcribe’ in the meeting options, which allows meeting organizers to select from two options: (1) organizers and co-organizers, or (2) organizers, co-organizers, and presenters. This control allows meeting organizers to manage which roles are able to initiate recording and transcription for a meeting.",
