  "title": "Microsoft Teams: Default enable transcription policy for new tenants",
  "description": "We are updating the default policy for Transcription from “off” to “on” for any new tenant. This change doesn’t mean that every meeting will automatically have transcription enabled, but it will allow users to turn on transcription if needed. This adjustment aligns the default Transcription policy with that of Recording, supporting broader adoption of Transcription and all AI features.",
