  "description": "Restricted SharePoint Search (RSS) is a setting that will allow Global/Tenant and SharePoint Admins to disable organization-wide search and select a set of curated SharePoint sites. These selected sites, along with the usersâ€™ OneDrive files and content, will then become accessible in search and in the Copilot experiences. This means that whether you have Enterprise Search or Restricted SharePoint Search enabled, users in your organization will still be able to interact with their OneDrive information in Copilot.",
