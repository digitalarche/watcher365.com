  "title": "Microsoft Copilot (Microsoft 365): New proactive assistance in Copilot ",
  "description": "Catch-up is a new experience in Copilot which aims to proactively help users catch up and take action on important updates. It contains a group of cards. Each card has an update related to an important meeting or document. It will work in M365chat and Teams Copilot. It shows up as a tab on the home page. This feature—Catch up tab which was released to some customers—will be rolled back completely. As a result of this roll back, no Copilot user will see the Catch up tab on the homepage of Copilot. All Copilot users will continue to see \"Try These Prompts\" as earlier. We apologize for the inconvenience.",
