  "description": "With Microsoft Teams Rooms, participants can be distinguished automatically regardless of what kind of device is capturing audio in a meeting, and their contributions are attributed in the transcript, making meetings more inclusive and productive. Speaker recognition will be enabled for any in-person meeting participant who has completed the simple face and voice enrollment process, and is included on the meeting invitation. They can also see auto-generated meeting action items assigned to them, important decisions, and meeting highlights by using Copilot.",
