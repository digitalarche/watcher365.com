  "description": "The new relevance recommendation in Message Center will help you determine how relevant a change is to your tenant. The recommendation (high, medium, or low) will be determined based on multiple factors, such as service usage and the type of change. We have paused the rollout to improve the recommendation, prior to proceeding and have adjusted the status to reflect this. Thank you for your patience.",
