  "description": ",We have listened customer feedback on Outlook mobile need meet the mission of \"On the Go\", and for organizations have mandatory labeling enabled without default labeling, and would like to have the label selection first before going to compose the email. Then when the users click \"Send\", the email could just be sent without any forgotten labeling pop ups. Outlook mobile will introduce a new MDM setting to allow admins to enable this louder mandatory configuration for Outlook mobile clients (iOS and Android) specifically. We will enable Android first in early Q1 of 2023, and iOS will release in Q2 of 2023.",
