  "description": "If you have a Microsoft Teams Premium license you can now set up SMS text notifications in Microsoft Bookings to be sent to the person booking an appointment. Currently, SMS notifications will be sent only when appointments are scheduled by an attendee via a published booking page. With this update, the capability is extended to include sending SMS confirmations and reminders to the attendee when appointments are booked through the calendar scheduling experience in Bookings by a scheduler or a staff member.",
