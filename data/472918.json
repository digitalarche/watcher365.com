  "description": "The Copilot page in the Microsoft 365 admin center is the dedicated place for managing Copilot. It will soon feature four sections: Overview, Health, Discover, and Settings. Overview will provide key metrics and insights including active user rate, AI assistance score, Copilot-assisted hours, and user sentiment. Health will consolidate Copilot-specific health insights such as device update status for Microsoft 365 apps, distribution of devices with diagnostic data, Copilot-specific message center posts, and known active issues. Discover will allow you to explore Copilot capabilities, understand user eligibility requirements, and access curated resources. These resources will cover compliance standards, adoption guidance, the Copilot prompt library, and more. You can also purchase Microsoft 365 Copilot licenses here. Settings will offer essential controls to configure Microsoft 365 Copilot to meet your organizationâ€™s needs and navigate to other key control surfaces including agent management and data security and compliance settings.",
