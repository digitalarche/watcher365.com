  "title": "Microsoft Teams: Specific People Link support for Collaborative Notes",
  "description": "With\nthe launch of Collaborative notes, weâ€™re also improving the shareable link type\nthat is created by Collaborative notes to help make meetings more effective and\nsecure. The new Collaborative notes component will generate a Specific People\nLink (PSL) by default. This link type offers more controlled access than\nCompany Specific Link (CSL). This change also aligns with tenants who have\ntheir file-sharing policy set as Specific People. Tenants who previously had\nCollaborative notes disabled due to lack of PSL support can now enable and use\nthe feature.",
