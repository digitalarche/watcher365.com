This improvement makes navigation more intuitive by treating shared resources as separate accounts, providing quick and organized access. As part of this update, we are removing the \"Shared With\" node from the folder pane. All shared resources will now be integrated directly into the accounts list for a cleaner and more consistent navigation experience. This update streamlines how shared resources are managed and accessed, helping you stay productive and focused. #newoutlookforwindows",
