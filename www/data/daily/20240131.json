For example, admins can configure the indicator “sending email with attachments to recipients outside the organization” to only detect emails sent to personal domains (e.g., outlook.com). In that way, admins can reduce the number of false positives. Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies to manage security and compliance. Built with privacy by design, users are pseudonymized by default, and role-based access controls and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy. Note: The cloud environments have been updated to show the current state.  We apologize for any incovenience this may cause.",

For example, admins can configure the indicator “sending email with attachments to recipients outside the organization” to only detect emails sent to personal domains (e.g., outlook.com). In that way, admins can reduce the number of false positives. Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies to manage security and compliance. Built with privacy by design, users are pseudonymized by default, and role-based access controls and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy. Note: The cloud environments have been updated to show the current state.  We apologize for any incovenience this may cause.",

      "description": ",We are introducing new version controls that help tenant and site admins or document library owners reduce the storage footprint driven by low value file versions. Today, document library owners can set count-based version limits at the individual document library level. With the upcoming changes, tenant and site admins or document library owners will have two version history settings: 1) Automatic mode that intelligently expires new and existing version based on their age and restore probability, and 2) Manual mode that will allow admins to set time-based version expiration and count limits on new and existing versions. These controls enable admins to set an appropriate level of recoverability and auditability for their organization balanced with storage usage considerations. Version history limits and management also apply to OneDrive for Business.",
