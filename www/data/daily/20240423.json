These sites cannot be excluded from the retention policy after the deletion of the group because of designed modern group scope. The site-level holds are applied when a group is added to a retention policy and the Tenant-level holds are applied when the complete modern group workload is added to a retention policy. Currently, to remove such a hold, the customer has to raise an escalation. With the rollout of this feature, users will be able to exclude the orphaned SPO site from both site-level holds and tenant-level holds as a self-service.",

These sites cannot be excluded from the retention policy after the deletion of the group because of designed modern group scope. The site-level holds are applied when a group is added to a retention policy and the Tenant-level holds are applied when the complete modern group workload is added to a retention policy. Currently, to remove such a hold, the customer has to raise an escalation. With the rollout of this feature, users will be able to exclude the orphaned SPO site from both site-level holds and tenant-level holds as a self-service.",
