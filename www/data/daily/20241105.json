This feature can be enabled through “Share data with Microsoft Defender XDR” within Microsoft Insider Risk Management settings. To ensure privacy of the data, all IRM data in Microsoft Defender XDR can only be accessed by users with Insider risk analyst or Insider risk investigator permissions in Purview. Existing analysts accessing IRM data in purview will continue to access IRM data in Microsoft Defender XDR. IRM data in Microsoft Defender XDR does not honor anonymization. This is to enable effective correlation of IRM alerts with alerts from other solutions in Microsoft Defender XDR platform (such as Defender for Endpoint, Defender for Cloud apps, etc.). Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations.

Endpoint DLP audits the egress activities for all user accounts that have been excluded (via the Exclude setting) or are otherwise not in scope.<br>More info: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/endpoint-dlp-get-started-jit?view=o365-worldwide",

      "description": "With this feature, IRM analysts can identify if the user being investigated has any compromise user alerts in Microsoft Entra. This will help them formulate the right response action, like escalating the Incident to SOC teams for quick remediation, etc. Microsoft Entra offers two types of compromised user detections: 1. Sign in risk detections - Compromise risk associated with a specific sign-in. 2. User risk detections - Compromise risk associated with a specific user. - Insider risk management admins can opt into each of the above risk detections from Insider risk management global settings. - Risk detections will be available in the indicator timeline within the alert investigation experience. - Risk detections will not impact the risk score or severity of Insider risk management alerts. Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies based on their own internal policies, governance, and organizational requirements. Built with privacy by design, users are pseudonymized by default, and role-based access controls and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy.<br>More info: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-protection/concept-identity-protection-risks",
