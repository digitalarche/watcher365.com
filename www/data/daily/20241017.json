The ability to filter reports will also be introduced. Users with the admin, analyst or investigator role will have access to view the new Alerts & cases report. Permissions for accessing analytics and user activity reports have not changed. Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies based on their own internal policies, governance, and organizational requirements. Built with privacy by design, users are pseudonymized by default, and role-based access controls and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy.",
