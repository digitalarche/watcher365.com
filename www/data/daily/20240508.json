Microsoft Purview Communication Compliance provides the tools to help organizations detect regulatory compliance violations (e.g. SEC and FINRA obligations), such as inappropriate sharing of sensitive or confidential information, harassing or threatening language and sharing of adult content. Communication Compliance enables customers to create policies based on their own internal policies, governance and organizational requirements. Built with privacy by design, usernames are pseudonymized by default, role-based access controls are built in, investigators are opted in by an admin, and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy.",
