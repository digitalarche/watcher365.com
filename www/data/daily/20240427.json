This allows admins to specify governance or compliance specialists who should have download access to meeting transcripts. We are also updating the default permissions so that even when the policy is not applied only transcript owners (recording initiator or meeting organizer) will have permission to download or delete the transcript file, while meeting participants can only view the transcript in Teams app or Stream. In addition to the tenant-wide policy for download permission, the meeting organizer will be able to select in Stream which participants are restricted from downloading, viewing, and editing the transcript in Stream.",
