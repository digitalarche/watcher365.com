The metrics on this dashboard are divided into the following sections: First, the Lifetime Video report contains 3 metrics for videos on the SharePoint site—Total Views, Unique Viewers, and Average Watch Rate. Second, Video Traffic report shows views and viewer patterns across the last 7 days, 30 days, and 90 days. Third, Video Usage shows views by device and geolocation. Fourth, Top 20 Videos shows a list of the most popular videos on the SharePoint site in the last week.
