This will help admins quickly assess the priority of an alert and determine the next steps before navigating to the Microsoft Purview DLP alerts page or Microsoft 365 Defender DLP alerts page.",

This reduces the risks of potential data leakage that customers often report as they move sensitive documents between SharePoint and 3rd party eSignature platforms. Manual download or upload of documents will no longer be required when initiating the request or when saving the signed documents back to SharePoint for long term storage.",
