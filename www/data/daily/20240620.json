Today, full column calculations produce a unique result in each row, but this new feature gives you the option to calculate all data in a column together to return one result. You can also create a row with formulas that apply for relevant columns; for example, an \"add total sales row\" will add a SUM formula underneath every column that has sales data.",

Admins have a need to delegate role-based permissions to users or analysts in a granular way. In some cases, this delegation is based on function, and in other cases it is based on geography or scope of work. In this release, Audit will provide role-based information with Audit search results through the UI.",
