If the meeting organizer deletes the transcript from Stream, only the copy in OneDrive for Business will be deleted. We also update the default permissions so that meeting organizer and co-organizers will have permission to download or delete the transcript file, while meeting participants can only view the transcript in Teams app or Stream. In addition, the recording/transcript file owner will be able to select in Stream which participants are restricted from downloading, viewing, and editing the transcript.
