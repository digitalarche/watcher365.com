This approach works until there's an authentication challenge to the cached credentials. A typical scenario is when a user changes their password on a different device. The cached credentials on the current device become outdated and SSO fails. Edge detects this failure and shows a re-authentication popup that prompts the user to update their cached credentials on the current device.",
