      "description": "App centric management for app deployment will introduce a new admin setting to control who in the tenant has specific Teams apps preinstalled. Similar to app assignments, admins will be able to select from three options: 'Deployed to all users', 'Deployed to specific users and groups', or 'Deployed to no users'. This feature replaces the existing Installed apps section of app setup policies and provides admins with the ability to manage app deployment individually. The Installed apps section of app setup policies for existing customers will be migrated to maintain existing admin settings in the tenant.",
