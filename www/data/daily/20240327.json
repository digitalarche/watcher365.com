For example, admins can configure the indicator “sending email with attachments to recipients outside the organization” to only detect emails sent to personal domains (e.g., outlook.com). In that way, admins can reduce the number of false positives. Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies to manage security and compliance. Built with privacy by design, users are pseudonymized by default, and role-based access controls and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy.
