Organizations can create label-based protection policies that specify which data sources, databases, or storage buckets are in scope, and which users or groups are allowed to access data with a certain sensitivity label and Purview will automatically enforce the policy and block unauthorized access to sensitive data. Insider Risk Management extends its detection into multicloud environments by offering ready-to-use risk indicators in Azure, AWS, and SaaS apps including Box, Dropbox, and Google Drive. Organizations can use these new indicators in data theft and data leaks policies. Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Note: We have updated the cloud environments to reflect the current state.  We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.",

      "description": ",Microsoft Purview Information Protection extends its sensitivity labels and protection policies into data contained in Azure SQL, Azure Data Lake Storage, and Amazon S3. Organizations can create label-based protection policies that specify which data sources, databases, or storage buckets are in scope, and which users or groups are allowed to access data with a certain sensitivity label and Purview will automatically enforce the policy and block unauthorized access to sensitive data. Insider Risk Management extends its detection into multicloud environments by offering ready-to-use risk indicators in Azure, AWS, and SaaS apps including Box, Dropbox, and Google Drive. Organizations can use these new indicators in data theft and data leaks policies. Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations.",

Organizations can create label-based protection policies that specify which data sources, databases, or storage buckets are in scope, and which users or groups are allowed to access data with a certain sensitivity label and Purview will automatically enforce the policy and block unauthorized access to sensitive data. Insider Risk Management extends its detection into multicloud environments by offering ready-to-use risk indicators in Azure, AWS, and SaaS apps including Box, Dropbox, and Google Drive. Organizations can use these new indicators in data theft and data leaks policies. Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Note: We have updated the cloud environments to reflect the current state.  We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.",
