The Quick Summarization feature consolidates this information into a single, easy-to-understand summary. Additionally, similar summary views are available for both Search and Hold within the eDiscovery case. Powered by existing “contextual summary” skill, the system analyzes case/search/hold metadata and generates natural language summaries, providing users with a clear, actionable overview of key details in real time.",
