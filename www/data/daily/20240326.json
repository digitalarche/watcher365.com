This settings pane is found by going to OneDrive icon in the system tray then selecting Settings- Sync and backup- Manage backup. The change will introduce toggle buttons to the settings pane along with information showing how much storage, of an end users total storage allotment, will be used by the feature. There is no change to the PC folder backup feature itself which, when enabled, automatically syncs your end user’s Desktop, Documents and Pictures folders on their Windows PC to their OneDrive.",

Admins with appropriate permissions will no longer need to enable browsing indicators from the insider risk settings page to gain visual insights of these activities. In addition, the feature has been updated with more precise detection when users switch between tabs and windows. This results in more reliable visual evidence insights when context is switched in the browser. Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies based on their own internal policies, governance, and organizational requirements.

This feature will come to the new Outlook for Windows and Outlook on the web. Your work location will reflect across Microsoft 365, such as in Teams and your profile card. You can also update your location from Teams which will stay in sync with Outlook. We are also introducing a new location type, out-of-office, which will automatically sync with your out-of-office calendar appointments. #newoutlookforwindows",
