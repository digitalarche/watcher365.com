The task publishing feature\nallows an organization to centrally define a set of work, choose the set of\nfrontline locations that should complete that work, create the appropriate\ntasks for each frontline location, and monitor how that work is going. One of\nthe top feature requests for task publishing has been the ability to create a\nset of tasks once and set them to automatically repeat at a scheduled cadence.\nCommon examples are daily opening and closing tasks or weekly/monthly site\ninspections and compliance walks. When this feature is available, you'll be\nable to set recurrence on a draft task list, which will allow you to choose the\ncadence (such as every month on the 15th of the month). You can then publish\nthe list and task publishing will take care of scheduling the publication so\nthat the list publishes automatically at that cadence going forward. We know\nfrom a wide range of customer conversations that this will be a big time saver\nfor distributing recurring tasks across frontline organizations.",

In that way, admins can reduce the number of false positives.

Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies to manage security and compliance.

      "description": "Admins can customize their organization's branding assets onto Edge for Business. Admins can enable and configure branding onto profile-related UI for profiles signed in with an Entra ID (formerly known as Azure Active Directory) account. You can configure your organization’s details such as name to the profile pill; name, logo, and brand color to the profile flyout; and logo to overlay the Edge for Business taskbar icon. This branding can help users more easily differentiate between multiple profiles and browser windows. The Microsoft Edge management service will give admins an enhanced experience to control, preview, and customize assets. Admins can control organization branding through the following policies: OrganizationColor, OrganizationLogo, OrganizationLogoOnAppIcon, OrganizationName. <br>More info: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/deployedge/microsoft-edge-for-business#company-branding",
