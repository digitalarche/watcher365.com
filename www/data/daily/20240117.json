      "description": "Policy tuning analysis provides admins with a real-time policy alert prediction based on the number of users in a tenant that could potentially match a given set of policy conditions. It helps organizations efficiently adjust the selection of indicators and thresholds of activity occurrence, so they don’t have too few or too many alerts from a policy. Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies based on their own internal policies, governance, and organizational requirements. Built with privacy by design, users are pseudonymized by default and role-based access controls and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy.",
