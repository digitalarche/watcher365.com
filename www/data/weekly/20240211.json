For example, admins can configure the indicator “sending email with attachments to recipients outside the organization” to only detect emails sent to personal domains (e.g., outlook.com). In that way, admins can reduce the number of false positives. Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies to manage security and compliance. Built with privacy by design, users are pseudonymized by default, and role-based access controls and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy. Note: The cloud environments have been updated to show the current state.  We apologize for any incovenience this may cause.",

      "description": ",Granular exclusion allows admins to adjust and fine tune indicators according to organizational preferences to help tailor the detection of risks that may lead to a potential security incident. For example, admins can configure the indicator “sending email with attachments to recipients outside the organization” to only detect emails sent to personal domains (e.g., outlook.com). In that way, admins can reduce the number of false positives. Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies to manage security and compliance.

The task publishing feature\nallows an organization to centrally define a set of work, choose the set of\nfrontline locations that should complete that work, create the appropriate\ntasks for each frontline location, and monitor how that work is going. One of\nthe top feature requests for task publishing has been the ability to create a\nset of tasks once and set them to automatically repeat at a scheduled cadence.\nCommon examples are daily opening and closing tasks or weekly/monthly site\ninspections and compliance walks. When this feature is available, you'll be\nable to set recurrence on a draft task list, which will allow you to choose the\ncadence (such as every month on the 15th of the month). You can then publish\nthe list and task publishing will take care of scheduling the publication so\nthat the list publishes automatically at that cadence going forward. We know\nfrom a wide range of customer conversations that this will be a big time saver\nfor distributing recurring tasks across frontline organizations.",

This reduces the risks of potential data leakage that customers often report as they move sensitive documents between SharePoint and 3rd party eSignature platforms. Manual download or upload of documents will no longer be required when initiating the request or when saving the signed documents back to SharePoint for long term storage.",

For example, admins can configure the indicator “sending email with attachments to recipients outside the organization” to only detect emails sent to personal domains (e.g., outlook.com). In that way, admins can reduce the number of false positives. Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies to manage security and compliance. Built with privacy by design, users are pseudonymized by default, and role-based access controls and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy.

These controls enable admins to set an appropriate level of recoverability and auditability for their organization balanced with storage usage considerations.
