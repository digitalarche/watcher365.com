Secondly, with the new OR condition capability, you can combine multiple conditions within the same policy, creating custom logic to suit your unique compliance requirements. Lastly, to make policy creation and updates a seamless process, we've introduced the ability to test conditions before implementing them.

First, our updated policy conditions enable the detection of messages sent and received both to and from external email addresses, allowing you to identify specific instances of information being shared with external contacts. Secondly, with the new OR condition capability, you can combine multiple conditions within the same policy, creating custom logic to suit your unique compliance requirements. Lastly, to make policy creation and updates a seamless process, we've introduced the ability to test conditions before implementing them. By using sample messages, you can evaluate how your conditions will perform and fine-tune them to align with your compliance goals.",

Insider Risk Management extends its detection into multicloud environments by offering ready-to-use risk indicators in Azure, AWS, and SaaS apps including Box, Dropbox, and Google Drive. Organizations can use these new indicators in data theft and data leaks policies. Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations.

      "description": ",Microsoft Purview Information Protection extends its sensitivity labels and protection policies into data contained in Azure SQL, Azure Data Lake Storage, and Amazon S3. Organizations can create label-based protection policies that specify which data sources, databases, or storage buckets are in scope, and which users or groups are allowed to access data with a certain sensitivity label and Purview will automatically enforce the policy and block unauthorized access to sensitive data. Insider Risk Management extends its detection into multicloud environments by offering ready-to-use risk indicators in Azure, AWS, and SaaS apps including Box, Dropbox, and Google Drive. Organizations can use these new indicators in data theft and data leaks policies. Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations.",
