Built with privacy by design, users are pseudonymized by default, and role-based access controls and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy.",

      "description": "Admins can customize their organization's branding assets through Microsoft Edge management service onto Edge for Business. Admins can enable and configure branding onto profile-related UI for profiles signed in with an Entra ID (formerly known as Azure Active Directory) account. You can configure your organization’s details such as name to the profile pill; name, logo, and brand color to the profile flyout; and logo to overlay the Edge for Business taskbar icon. This branding can help users more easily differentiate between multiple profiles and browser windows. \nThis Microsoft Edge management service will give admins an enhanced experience to control, preview, and customize assets.<br>More info: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/deployedge/microsoft-edge-for-business#company-branding",

Admins can enable and configure branding onto profile-related UI for profiles signed in with an Entra ID (formerly known as Azure Active Directory) account. You can configure your organization’s details such as name to the profile pill; name, logo, and brand color to the profile flyout; and logo to overlay the Edge for Business taskbar icon. This branding can help users more easily differentiate between multiple profiles and browser windows. \nThis Microsoft Edge management service will give admins an enhanced experience to control, preview, and customize assets.<br>More info: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/deployedge/microsoft-edge-for-business#company-branding",
