Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies to manage security and compliance. Built with privacy by design, users are pseudonymized by default, and role-based access controls and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy.

Secondly, with the new OR condition capability, you can combine multiple conditions within the same policy, creating custom logic to suit your unique compliance requirements. Lastly, to make policy creation and updates a seamless process, we've introduced the ability to test conditions before implementing them.
