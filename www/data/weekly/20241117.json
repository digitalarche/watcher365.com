Key changes with export enhancements: The biggest change being introduced is that with the new user experience for eDiscovery where Standard and Premium cases have unified structure, the export is also aligned for both the streams – thereby providing a singular experience to customers. The behavior is now unified across all export jobs - same download experience, some report experience, same error messages. For Standard customers, the need to install a clickonce application in their machine and use that tool to download data for exporting in azure storage is history. Now, in the new experience, customers don’t need to install the app anymore and can download directly through browser. Additionally, customers will experience a faster export capability in the new portal driven through enhancements in backend architecture and optimized partition.",

Guests can sign in to the Mesh app to join events, participate in discussions, and experience the same interactive features as internal users, all while maintaining secure access control. Guest user creation follows the existing process for tenant guest user creation (outside of Mesh). For this release, guest users would require a Teams Premium license, just like regular tenant attendees, to collaborate within Mesh. Guest access for the Mesh app on Quest and support for anonymous participants will be supported in a future update.",

Key changes with export enhancements: The biggest change being introduced is that with the new user experience for eDiscovery where Standard and Premium cases have unified structure, the export is also aligned for both the streams – thereby providing a singular experience to customers. The behavior is now unified across all export jobs - same download experience, some report experience, same error messages. For Standard customers, the need to install a clickonce application in their machine and use that tool to download data for exporting in azure storage is history. Now, in the new experience, customers don’t need to install the app anymore and can download directly through browser. Additionally, customers will experience a faster export capability in the new portal driven through enhancements in backend architecture and optimized partition.",
