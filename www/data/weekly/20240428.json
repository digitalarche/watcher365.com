These sites cannot be excluded from the retention policy after the deletion of the group because of designed modern group scope. The site-level holds are applied when a group is added to a retention policy and the Tenant-level holds are applied when the complete modern group workload is added to a retention policy. Currently, to remove such a hold, the customer has to raise an escalation. With the rollout of this feature, users will be able to exclude the orphaned SPO site from both site-level holds and tenant-level holds as a self-service.",

Second, Video Traffic report shows views and viewer patterns across the last 7 days, 30 days, and 90 days. Third, Video Usage shows views by device and geolocation. Fourth, Top 20 Videos shows a list of the most popular videos on the SharePoint site in the last week.

These sites cannot be excluded from the retention policy after the deletion of the group because of designed modern group scope. The site-level holds are applied when a group is added to a retention policy and the Tenant-level holds are applied when the complete modern group workload is added to a retention policy. Currently, to remove such a hold, the customer has to raise an escalation. With the rollout of this feature, users will be able to exclude the orphaned SPO site from both site-level holds and tenant-level holds as a self-service.",
