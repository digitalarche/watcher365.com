This allows admins to specify governance or compliance specialists who should have download access to meeting transcripts. We are also updating the default permissions so that even when the policy is not applied only transcript owners (recording initiator or meeting organizer) will have permission to download or delete the transcript file, while meeting participants can only view the transcript in Teams app or Stream. In addition to the tenant-wide policy for download permission, the meeting organizer will be able to select in Stream which participants are restricted from downloading, viewing, and editing the transcript in Stream.",

This policy applies to new meeting transcripts across the entire organization. Administrators can exempt people who are members of specified security groups from the policy. This allows admins to specify governance or compliance specialists who should have download access to meeting transcripts. We are also updating the default permissions so that even when the policy is not applied only transcript owners (recording initiator or meeting organizer) will have permission to download or delete the transcript file, while meeting participants can only view the transcript in Teams app or Stream. In addition to the tenant-wide policy for download permission, the meeting organizer will be able to select in Stream which participants are restricted from downloading, viewing, and editing the transcript in Stream.",

This ensures that organizations can receive critical alerts without being throttled by these limits. By default, the throttling limits will be applied as follows: All sensitive triggers, including HR signals, Azure AD leavers, and custom triggers, will be limited to 15,000 per day per trigger. All other triggers will be limited to 5,000 per day per trigger. Additionally, the policy health warning messages will be enhanced to assist admins with appropriate permissions in identifying and addressing noisy triggers effectively. Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies based on their own internal policies, governance, and organizational requirements. Built with privacy by design, users are pseudonymized by default, and role-based access controls and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy.",
