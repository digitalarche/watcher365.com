The Alert Spotlighting feature uses this information to decide whether an alert can be spotlighted. Based on a detailed study of alert triage patterns across tenants, we have developed a rule-based algorithm to spotlight alerts that would be of importance to admins, based on historical volume analysis. \nMicrosoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies based on their own internal policies, governance, and organizational requirements.
