Analysts can leverage KQL queries to identify potentially hidden risky patterns in data security related user activity. 3. IRM alert, Indicators, and enriched events will be exposed through Graph API. This feature can be enabled through “Share data with Microsoft Defender XDR” within Microsoft Insider Risk Management settings. To ensure privacy of the data, all IRM data in Microsoft Defender XDR can only be accessed by users with Insider risk analyst or Insider risk investigator permissions in Purview. Existing analysts accessing IRM data in purview will continue to access IRM data in Microsoft Defender XDR. IRM data in Microsoft Defender XDR does not honor anonymization. This is to enable effective correlation of IRM alerts with alerts from other solutions in Microsoft Defender XDR platform (such as Defender for Endpoint, Defender for Cloud apps, etc.). Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies based on their own internal policies, governance, and organizational requirements.

Files downloaded from these libraries are protected at download. Users accessing these files outside of SharePoint Online have their rights evaluated in real time against the online copy of the document. Changes to user permissions on the online copy of the document are reflected on downloaded copy, including full access removal.

This will help them formulate the right response action, like escalating the Incident to SOC teams for quick remediation, etc. Microsoft Entra offers two types of compromised user detections: 1. Sign in risk detections - Compromise risk associated with a specific sign-in. 2. User risk detections - Compromise risk associated with a specific user. - Insider risk management admins can opt into each of the above risk detections from Insider risk management global settings. - Risk detections will be available in the indicator timeline within the alert investigation experience. - Risk detections will not impact the risk score or severity of Insider risk management alerts. Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies based on their own internal policies, governance, and organizational requirements.

      "title": "Microsoft Purview compliance portal: Information Protection - SharePoint Online extends library permissions to downloaded files.",
      "description": "This new capability ties together SharePoint Online library permissions with Purview sensitivity labeling and protection. SharePoint Online document library owners can set a label on the library, automatically applying that label to all unprotected and unlabeled Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and PDF files at rest in the target library. This simplifies labeling in bulk across document libraries in an organization. This capability also helps protect files as they egress from the original document library, such as for collaboration purposes or attempted exfiltration. Files downloaded from these libraries are protected at download. Users accessing these files outside of SharePoint Online have their rights evaluated in real time against the online copy of the document. Changes to user permissions on the online copy of the document are reflected on downloaded copy, including full access removal. This provides a more streamlined way to revoke access to documents for individual users, versus revoking access on a per-document basis.",
